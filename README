Here is an apology:
So I started writing code 
when I was a young lad about a year ago
I'm still a young lad
but I know a lot more than I did
as I changed my styles and vices
so did the code held within the bounds of this project
stuff just sorta happens, you know what I mean?

How to install:
make help
it will tell you all you need to know.

What is this project?
It's a programming language, it's called FACT
It's okay I guess, I mean nothing fantastic.
It's something called SCOPE ORIENTED, which I still don't
know exactly what that means.
Have fun!
(It's also an OK calculator).
